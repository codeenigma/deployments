  # 4. If $buildtype.settings.php doesn't exist, raise a SystemExit and get out.
  # 5. If $buildtype.settings.php DOES exist, add a commented line to the bottom of it to say it copied to settings.inc and to not include $buildtype.settings.php in it, otherwise there'd be duplicate config values.
  # 6. If settings.php exists, see if it contains the file_exists() check, and if it doesn't, append that check to the bottom of settings.php.
  # 7. If a settings.inc file was found:
  # 8. Check if it contains the comment from #5 and if it does, do NOT append file_exists() check to bottom of file.
  # 9. If comment from #5 is not found, append file_exists() check to bottom of file
